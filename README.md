**RIDE-SHARING APP PROTOTYPE**
As part of my internship, I was assigned the task of building a prototype for a Ride-Sharing App. The goal of this project was to simulate the basic functionality of a ride-hailing application, where users can see their location, request a ride, and view driver details. This app is not a full-fledged ride-matching platform, but rather a functional prototype meant to demonstrate key features such as location tracking, ride request simulation, and integration with Firebase backend and Google Maps SDK. I used Kotlin and developed the app using Android Studio, while Firebase was used for storing ride requests and dummy driver information.

In this app, users can view their current location on the map, which is made possible through Google Maps integration and location permissions. A “Request Ride” button allows the user to simulate a ride request. When clicked, the app stores dummy driver data (such as name, car model, and arrival time) in Firestore and displays a marker on the map showing a fake driver location. At the same time, the app shows the driver details on the screen to make the prototype look more realistic. This feature gave me a better understanding of working with real-time databases and handling user interface updates based on backend data.

Through this task, I learned how to integrate third-party services like Google Maps and Firebase in an Android application. I also got experience with managing permissions, location services, and cloud database operations. This project gave me practical exposure to building location-based apps and using backend tools effectively. It was a great opportunity to apply my Android development skills in a meaningful and real-world scenario.
